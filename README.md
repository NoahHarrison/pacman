# PacMen 

This project demonstrates the canvas-detection feature while designing games, like PacMan.

## How to Run
#### 1. Running the project locally.
- To run this project locally, first clone the repository using `git clone`.
- Once the project is cloned, go to the directory of the cloned repo and open it using VSCode
- Make sure you have the extension called `Live Server` in order to launch the project page locally. 
- Once the folder is imported into VSCode, open `index.html` and right-click anywhere in file. Click on the option `Open With Live Server`. This hosts the project locally in your default browser.

#### 2. Running the project using your browser without cloning.
- Go to the URL https://noahharrison.github.io/noahportfolio/
- Navigate to the `Projects` button to find different projects, like PacMan, Eyeballs and BusMap.

## Roadmap of future improvements

- Since this is only the beginning of launching a full fledged version PacMan, here's some potential improvements:
1.  replace the image in a timed loop to have pacman open and close his mouth.
2.  reverse direction of the image when it hits the x axis wall.
